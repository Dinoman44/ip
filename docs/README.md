# Fret User Guide

<img src=''>

Fret, named after the player support AI Fret from [Halo Infinite](https://www.halopedia.org/FRET), is a chatbot that will take note of your tasks and allow you to mark, delete, save tasks and also add other tasks as needed.

The tone of the bot when you give it commands mimics its voice lines in-game and suits its personality well:
> "Fret AI constructs are able to remain eager to tackle the task ahead"


## Adding Tasks

There are 3 types of tasks that Fret can handle. Each of them requires a separate set of commands.
